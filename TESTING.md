With the unit test in `test_app.py` we test two functions: `search_term` and `update_dropdown_options`. For `search_term` we test that the function finds the term in the dataframe and also test that the return is empty if a search term is provided that is not in the dataframe. Fro `update_dropdown_options`, we want to check that if we provide an empty string as search value a `PreventUpdate` error is raised. We also test that if search_term is `None` the error is raised. We check that the options are correctly updated when a new search value is provided in `test_update_dropdown_options_with_search_value()`
. One thing that might occur is that when updating the options, the previously existing values are erased and only the newly found options are returned. To ensure that this is not the case the `test_update_dropdown_options_with_state` function is used.
